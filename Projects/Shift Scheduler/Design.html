        <h1>What is "the Book"</h1>
        <h3>and how does this JavaScript work?</h3><br /><br />
        <div style="width:65%">

            "The Book" is what we call the Daily assignment sheet at the Chick-fil-A I've worked at for 4 years now.
            <br /><br />
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td style="width:33%"> <img src="Design/7-8 book.jpg" style="width:200px"/></td>
                    <td style="width:33%"> <img src="Design/10-12 Book.jpg" style="width:200px"/></td>
                    <td style="width:33%"> <img src="Design/duties book.jpg" style="width:200px"/></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br /><br />
           
            Above you will see that there many positions across the day, with each hour's setup based
            on sales. You will see the most positions from 12-1, as its the peak hour at the Drive-Thru.<br /><br />
            For this store, and most others, the shift can be split up between three major areas:
            <ul>
                <li>Front (Inside)</li>
                <li>Drive Thru (Inside)</li>
                <li>Drive Thru (Outside)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Doing the book involves taking the people on the schedule, and
            placing them in position based off some basic criteria:
            <ol>
                <li>Best people in DT positions from 12-1</li>
                <li>No one is in the same position back-to-back, e.g. 10-12 DT Bagger and 12-1 DT Bagger</li>
                <li>No one outside more than twice</li>
                <li>Not everyone can do F2F due to health concerns</li>
                <li>Not everyone can restock</li>
                <li>Leave senior managers free after 1, and before noon if possible.</li>
                <li>The Front Manager should not take a  DT position before 1, if at all. Needs to be able to run the shift.</li>
                <li>The Catering Manager should not take a DT position before 1, to take care of catering orders.</li>
            </ol>

            There are others, but these are the basics. So the challenge for anyone doing the book, and so my script, is to take 12-15 people
            and fill 48 positions with regard to sales, time, and the rules listed above.<br /><br />
            Realistically, it would be next to impossible for a program to do the entire thing without need for any correction.
            Some days, people are sick. Sometimes they don't feel up to a certain position and switch with others. Sometimes (most often),
            leaders don't want to do certain jobs and switch them out. What I've tried to do with this script is make a tool
            for new leaders to greatly reduce the number of variables involved in planning the day. Some edits are needed, and
            some I've left blank on purpose (like key DT positions 12-1), because its better for the manager to make that choice. Regardless,
            the number of options goes from 48 to around 5, and it without doubt reduces errors and time required to finish.<br /><br />
