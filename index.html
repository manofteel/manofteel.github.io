        <i>The Book. </i> The roster that my Chick-fil-A uses to assign positions and duties for every morning shift. With 48 positions
        for 13-15 Team Members, and a host of rules about who can be where and when, the process can be convoluted to say the least. I've taken the basic
        rules of the "doing the book" and made 13 positions that balance their placement across the shift. 
        Basic rules of doing the Book:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>No one goes outside more than twice</li>
            <li>No one is in the same position two hours in a row</li>
            <li>No one is in similar positions two hours in a row (window and expediter, DT Bagger and Front Bagger, etc.)</li>
            <li>Front Manager is free from position to run the shift until 1</li>
            <li>Senior Managers are out of position before 12, and don't have restocking duties</li>
            <li>The best team members for the key DT positions are reserved for 12-1, the peak hour. </li>

        </ul>
        There are others, but these are the basics. The questions are ordered intentionally, to ensure the team members used are able to fill their positions. 
        When finished, there are 4 open positions. With available team members listed on the side, this makes the process significantly quicker and has been handy for me.
